# Atlanta Beltline
Developed by CS4400 Team 5 (Spring 2019).

The purpose of this project is to create an application system that stores information about the Atlanta BeltLine sites and events.

The application keeps track of the visitors who visit the different sites and events, the users who take transits that connect various sites, and the employees who work in the Atlanta BeltLine system.
